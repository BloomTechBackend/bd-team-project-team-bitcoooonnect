# Team Bitcoooonnect Reflection

## Design

Our user stories and general design stayed similar from the document to our end product, and our data modeling and endpoints stayed somewhat similar. We did end up changing how we authorized users and stored some attributes, which meant changes to tables and endpoints had to be made. We also ended up switching the external API we used to get coin prices from CoinGecko to CoinMarketCap.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?

  * Our project is something we would actually be users of, so I think that made it easier for us to think about what users would want to do with our service. Creating UML diagram for an endpoint was a good way to force us to think about all that would need to be built.

* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?

  * Talking through the problems with each other helped, trying to utilize all of our collective programming experience,  and then also utilizing debuggers in IDEs and using loggers, console on the front end to help visualize problems better. And then of course the best resource, Google.


## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?

  * Being able to discuss blockers, bugs we were working through at the time, and leaning on our varied past programming experiences to help come up with solutions.

* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

  * We underestimated the work it would take to complete our front-end during sprint 3. Being more thourough during the design process during sprint 1 would have helped use better estimate the time it would have taken, as we ended up having to make changes that took a lot of time unexpectedly.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?

  * Start using a framework right away for the front end instead of building first in plain HTML/CSS/JS
  * Get an earlier start on front end work
  * Created more diagrams during design phase / spend more time thinking deeply about our project structure during the design phase in general
  * We see ourselves spending more time on the design phase of future projects
